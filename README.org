* Silver-Brain 

** Overview

*** Prologue

Back to the time when I was preparing the final examinations as a bachelor student. I wrote down all the concepts to a big white paper in a structured way in order to review what I have learned. I draw lines between concepts and labeled the relationship. For each concept, I wrote some text describing it (usually the paper was too small for large trunk of text).

After Emacs and its decent Org Mode became best partner for my electronic life, I always wanted a software that helps me record everything in a structured way, like described above.

I found [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][org-brain]]. I used it for some time, but there were some drawbacks that made me stop using it:
- [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain/issues/127][Issue #127]] is a very important reason. Not being able to use rich-text in it really made me sad.
- Although it is doable via ~org-brain-rename-file~, but the inconsistency between file name and concept name made me uncomfortable, really.

*** Introduction

Silver Brain is a [[https://www.thebrain.com/][Brain]] like software and is directly inspired by [[https://github.com/Kungsgeten/org-brain][org-brain]]. It helps you build your very own personal knowledge center. 

It has the following features:

- Edit concepts using Emacs Org Mode (or probably other major modes in future).
- Maintain the relationship between concepts, including paternity and friendship.

The following technical decisions were made:

- Concepts are stored in a single SQLite file. Easy to maintain and synchronize.
- Separation between back-end and front-end. This makes it possible to develop another UI. The directory ~web-ui/~ contains a proof-of-concept demonstration.
- Back-end code was written in Common Lisp (a bless or a curse).

** Usage

*** Installation

**** External Dependencies

~SQLite 3~ is the only external software it depends on.

**** Installing Back-End Server

***** Roswell Way

It is highly recommended to use Roswell to build and install Lisp systems for its simplicity.
